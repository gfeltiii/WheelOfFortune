        <h1>Wheel of Fortune Rules</h1>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Wheel of Fortune</strong>! Below are the rules of the game:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the game is to guess the letters of a hidden phrase or word before time runs out.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Setup:</strong> The game consists of a spinning wheel divided into segments. Each segment represents a different cash value or a special prize.</li>
            <li><strong>How to Play:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The player will take turns spinning the wheel.</li>
                    <li>Each time the wheel stops, the player is given the opportunity to guess a letter in the phrase.</li>
                    <li>If the guessed letter is in the phrase, the player earns the amount indicated on the wheel and the letter will be revealed.</li>
                    <li>If the guessed letter is not in the phrase, the turn is passed to the next player.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Special Segments:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bankrupt:</strong> If the wheel lands on "Bankrupt," the player loses all accumulated earnings for that round.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free Play:</strong> A "Free Play" allows a player to guess a letter without risking money if the letter is not in the phrase.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Winning:</strong> The player who correctly guesses all the letters of the phrase wins the round. The game continues with new phrases until a final winner is declared.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Round:</strong> In the final round, the player will have a limited amount of time to guess the remaining letters in the phrase. If they succeed, they win the grand prize.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Good luck, and have fun spinning the wheel!</p>
